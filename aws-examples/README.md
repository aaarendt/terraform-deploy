# AWS Deployment Examples

This folder houses different deployments to be used as examples.

### `minimal-deployment/`

This is meant as the
[Zero-to-JupyterHub-K8s](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
equivalent setup. It's a very short, minimally configured setup that deploys
enough infrastructure to support a JupyterHub deployment.
